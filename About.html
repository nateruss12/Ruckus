        <p>My name is Nathan Russell. this website was created for my CIS133 class. I dedicated the website to my dog
            who's name is Ruckus. He recently turned 16 years old so I wanted to share a bit of his life with this
            website. Ruckus has been in the family since 2006 and after 10 years of fun and friendship, we're still
            enjoying life together everyday. I hope you enjoy this small website I've dedicated to him.</p>
